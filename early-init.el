;; Decreases Emacs load time by not loading unneeded features
;; Reference: https://github.com/SystemCrafters/rational-emacs/blob/master/early-init.el

;; Increase the GC threshold for faster startup
;; The default is 800 kilobytes.  Measured in bytes.

;; Prefer loading newest compiled .el file

;; Native compilation settings
(when (featurep 'native-compile)
  ;; Silence compiler warnings as they can be pretty disruptive
  (setq native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors nil)

  ;; Make native compilation happens asynchronously

  ;; Set the right directory to store the native compilation cache

;; Don't use package.el, we'll use straight.el instead

;; Remove some unneeded UI elements (the user can turn back on anything they wish)
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
